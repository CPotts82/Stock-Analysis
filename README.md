# Stock-Analysis
## Overview
### Background
  In this analysis I am helping a finance graduate research alternative energy stocks to help his clients invest wisely and diversely.  The clients would like to put all money into one particular stock, DAQO, however research must be done on the DAQO stock as well as other renewable energy stocks to make sure this is a wise choice. The clients have done no research on there own, they just know that they would like to invest in green energy.  
### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to not only research the DAQO stock for the clients but to also research other renewable energy stocks that could possibly be invested in.  This research will consist of finding the Total Daily Volume (how often a stock was traded in a year), as well as the Yearly Return.  The clients are specifically interested in the volume and return for 2018 but we will write code so we can compare 2018 to 2017. I will start with writing code to analyze one stock (DAQO), then reuse the code to analyze 12 different stocks and ultimately refactor the code so that it will work on the entire stock market that will work across the last few years.
